# Final Project

In this project, I've build a web application that searches for short exercises based on user needs regarding time, body area and pace

## How does it work

On homepage a user should check options for all three filters. Only after all three filters are chosen, the "Find video" button can show random video result based on the filters. When the search button is clicked, the app builds an array of video links that match those criteria and randomly chooses one video from that array, thus, user has a variety of workouts.

The filters are hided and the video takes the whole page, a user can save it to favorites by clicking on the heart icon. This information is stored on 'Favorite videos' page. 

A user can click on white area to show the filters again. 

He can also go to journal. THe journal page shows all the workouts, a user has ever done, including the information about time, pace, area, date, and link.

A user can also check out his favorite videos by clicking on "Favorite videos" page. It shows the workout name and also the video, so a user can play it right from there.

To start a new workout click on "Start new exercise"
